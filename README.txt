# MODEL.PY
# the design of sqlmodel just like pydantic model
# sqlmodel work as pydantic(data validation) and sqlalchemy model(conver model into table)
# when table=true(called table model) then sqlmodel work both as a pydantic and sqlalchemy model
# also possible without table=true(called data model) it work only as a pydantic model and also used for outschema


# FIELD ID
 # id field/column is the primary key of the table.
    # But inside the SQL database, it is always required and can't be NULL. Why should we declare it with Optional?
    # The id will be required in the database, but it will be generated by the database, not by our code.
